# stop-food-waste
This app were created for helping people prevent wasting food.
Worldwide, 1.3 tonnes of food are throw annually. Can you image that? It's a big big alarm sign!
Basically this application is telling you how much of food do you need and it prevents you to add much more than is neccesary.
Of course there are some Machine Learning algorithms behind that make recommandation based on your shopping list. For this part we have used Recommebe API.
