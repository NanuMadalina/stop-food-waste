# stop-food-waste
This app were created for helping people prevent wasting food.
<br>
Worldwide, 1.3 tonnes of food are throw annually. Can you image that? It's a big big alarm sign!
<br>
Basically this application is telling you how much of food do you need and it prevents you to add much more than is neccesary. This part was implemented based on the user profile (gender) and of course it was calculated on the average of a normal person consumption.
<br>
Of course there are some Machine Learning algorithms behind that make recommandation based on your shopping list. For this part it was used Recommebe API(Both Python 2 and Python 3 are supported).


The main idea behind it is for the registered user to monitor the raw products they
buy having a limit of kilocalories per day in each list.
<br>The flow would the following one: a person needs to register in order to gain
access to the app, they log in and then they have a product list which contains
products of every category, including the number of kilocalories for a certain
amount of the specified product. The user can, then, save the list, and then can
view the history, which contains all the lists.
<br>In this project I took care of the design and arhitecture of the project and database, also I implemented backend tasks and some bugs that we discovered afterwards(lists and history functionalities). 
<b>We used Agile as development methodology, keeping track of everything that needed to be
implemented and resolved.
